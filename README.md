# Synaxus: Your Second Brain. AI-powered, privacy-first, and built to last.

Synaxus is a desktop application that combines the power of AI with the clarity of mind mapping. It's designed for students, researchers, and creators who need a private, offline-first space to think deeply, connect ideas, and accelerate their learning process.

Unlike cloud-based tools, Synaxus runs entirely on your machine. Your data, your API keys, and your thoughts are never sent to a third-party server. Your knowledge is yours alone, stored locally in open formats (JSON & Markdown) so you're never locked in.
